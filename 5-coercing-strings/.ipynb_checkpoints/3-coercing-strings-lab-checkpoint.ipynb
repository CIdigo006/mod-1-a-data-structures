Our waitress did not miss a beat! \\xa0She was able to get everyone's order and come back to make sure we were taken care of. \\xa0Top Notch! \\xa0Max hit the spot of providing a little of something for everyone from the menu. \\xa0The cocktails were also really good with a nice kick! The comfort food hit the spot for me.... \\xa0I was really loving the greens and fried chicken. Now when I added the waffles to the dish it makes the perfect combination.
