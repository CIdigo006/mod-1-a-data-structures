    "\n",
    "* Prove we know it\n",
    "\n",
    "By asking us to write down content, outlining ensures that we really can explain the course material in an easily digestible manner.  If we don't know how to explain the material, then we can always use Google for some inspiration.  As the old saying goes, \"If you cannot explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.\"  \n",

    "* Facilitates Retention of Material\n",

    "Outlining also facilitates learning through chunking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Chunking is a process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole. The chunks by which the information is grouped are meant to improve short-term retention of the material, thus bypassing the limited capacity of working memory and allowing the working memory to be more efficient.\n",

    "* Organized Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, outlining is a practice in organizing your thoughts, and organizing the way that you communicate.  Speaking professionally is not just about tone or friendliness, but how you convey information to others.  An excellent way to do this, is to provide organization to the way you convey information, and to convey the most essential material.  Because outlines provide a hierarchy, it naturally provides training in these goals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if someone asks you to describe a strings in Python, you may start with the definition, and then say it has various methods.  Then instead rattling off a list of methods, it's even better if you can provide some organization to them. "
